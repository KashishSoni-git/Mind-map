Inspiration
I got inspiration for building this project from ongoing mental stress in college students !

What it does
The web-app is currently in very begining stage. Any student can visit here and can ask any query to their councilor, basically the councilor will be their college professor itself .The data of the query will not be saved as it would enable student to express their thoughts in free-manner. Also students can take a depression test where based in particular factors they can check what is their depression level. There is also a blog section where students can read specefic blogs related to stress-management,healthy diet,etc. There is also one feature of subscribing which would send time to time updates to students related to different topics.

How we built it
 Express , MongoDB and Node js for building backend. Also we trained a basic ml model to calculate the stress factor in student, for this we used jupyter notebook.Also included a survey form to make more accurate predictions.

Challenges we ran into
Intially we had difficulties in desciding tech stack and the features which we are going to add , but we came up with few basic features to make sure that app performs well.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Atleast we can make basic setup for the project and soon within few months we can convert it into full stacked web application.

What we learned
We learnt that how to train ML Model and what algorithms to use for best score. Also we learnt to make a full stack application

What's next for Stress-Management
Next we are going to convert the basic web app to a full stack production grade application. We will make sure that students are able to connect with their councillors , also a video streaming fascility would be added for the same purpose.
